  <h2>Trader Joe’s – <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">http://www.traderjoes.com/</a></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bright, seasonal, and feels on-brand and welcoming.</li>
    <li>Top header with key links (Stores, About, Careers, Announcements, Search, Shopping List) and a large hero promoting the “Fearless Flyer”; a vertical ribbon on the left groups sections like Products, Discover, Recipes, and Listen.</li>
    <li>The structure makes sense: clear global nav at the top, section shortcuts on the left, and content guiding you to products. It seems like there is a lot going on which could confuse some people.</li>
    <li>High-quality photography and clean card layouts enhance the experience. They are seasonal pictures.</li>
    <li>It loaded quickly for me; very reasonable for a homepage.</li>
    <li>This was readible for me. Light colored background with black lettering on top of it.</li>
    <li>Yes, both a top navigation and a left “ribbon” tool are easy to use and consistent.</li>
    <li>Warm reds/earth tones and textured neutrals are repeated throughout which give it an inviting look and feel.</li>
    <li>Responsive elements reflow into stacked sections. It requires more searching and clicking to find what you need, but I feel it is created well.</li>
    <li>When you scroll down there are seasonal products that they are selling. They included recipes that you can use that product for. I feel this is unusual and very well done for a grocery store.</li>
  </ol>


  <h2>Pitchfork – <a href="http://pitchfork.com/">http://pitchfork.com/</a></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Minimalist, editorial vibe with a bold black masthead—clearly a media site.</li>
    <li>Horizontal category navigation (News, Reviews, Best New Music, Features, Lists, Columns, Video) with a content grid and a “Latest” sidebar located on the right.</li>
    <li>Structure is logical for a magazine: categories up top, featured stories large, and timely items ordered on the right in a feed.</li>
    <li>Strong typography and large imagery create a magazine-style layout and ad slots are visible but don’t ruin the design.</li>
    <li>The load time was reasonable.</li>
    <li>High contrast black/white palette with multiple font sizes. The only issue is that it is all black and white, which makes a lot of the coloring blurr together.</li>
    <li>Yes, a clear global navigation and section filters; the navigation feels standard and effective for browsing content.</li>
    <li>Consistent theme with accent images; the look feels uniform across sections.</li>
    <li>The grid collapses into stacked articles on smaller screens. It is not my favorite, but it is not terrible.</li>
    <li>Signature “Reviews” and “Best New Music” labeling provide quick value for music discovery.</li>
  </ol>


  <h2>Jamilin – <a href="http://www.jamilin.com/">http://www.jamilin.com/</a></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Busy and old first impression with many colors, badges, and large banners.</li>
    <li>Primary navigation appears as colorful tab-like buttons; content sections (e.g., Galactic Spirit, Reverse Aging, Feng Shui) are presented as distinct tiles and links.</li>
    <li>Somewhat confusing: many topics compete for attention and everything isn’t consistent, so it takes effort to decide where to click.</li>
    <li>Graphics look low-resolution; the crowded layout detracts from usability and makes scanning harder.</li>
    <li>The load time was acceptable.</li>
    <li>Readability varies: some headings have adequate contrast, but several color combinations (bright text on colored backgrounds) make it harder to read.</li>
    <li>There is a navigation area, but the design and labeling are inconsistent, which makes it less effective.</li>
    <li>Color usage is not cohesive; different bright palettes across sections reduce the sense of a unified look and feel.</li>
    <li>Appears minimally responsive; elements don’t reflow cleanly and can require pinching/zooming on small screens.</li>
    <li>The eclectic mix of topics (Feng Shui, skincare, “Galactic Spirit”) is unusual and may appeal to a very specific audience.</li>
  </ol>
